      <h1>GNL's Not Lao</h1>
      <h2>Version 3</h2>
      <h3 id="caveat">Caveat</h3>

      <p>This document attempts to draw the texts of several popular English translations of Lao Tse into a consistent and accessible context. It is based on the translations of Robert G. Henricks, Lin Yutang, D.C. Lau, Ch'u Ta-Kao, Gia-Fu Feng &amp; Jane English, Richard Wilhelm and Aleister Crowley.</p>

      <p>This work is not a translation, but an interpolation.  It does not represent the original text; the original, if there was an original, has been jumbled, mistranscribed and reinterpreted many times over many thousands of years, and is here cast into a language that is incapable of presenting its poetic structure and philological connections.</p>

      <p>Even an original text, translated as faithfully as possible, might remain inaccessible to the modern reader unable to place it within its original context. The intention of this work is to construct a document that closely corresponds with the best modern translations of Lao Tse, but which is blunt, easy and useful to read within a modern context.</p>

      <h3 id="structure">Structural Changes</h3>
      <ul class="structural-changes">
        <li>The last three lines of chapter 28 have been moved to the end of Chapter 27.</li>
        <li>The last three lines of chapter 39 have been moved to the end of Chapter 26.</li>
        <li>The last three lines of chapter 47 oppose most translations.</li>
        <li>The first three lines of chapter 54 have been moved to the start of Chapter 38.</li>
        <li>The last two lines of chapter 55, a repetition of the last two lines of chapter 30, have been removed.</li>
        <li>The first line of chapter 60 has been moved to the start of chapter 59.</li>
        <li>Chapter 64 is split into two chapters, 64a and 64b.</li>
        <li>In chapter 64a the order of the second and third paragraphs is reversed.</li>
        <li>The last four lines of Chapter 67 have been moved to the start of Chapter 68.</li>

            <section id="the-way" class="chapter">
              <h2>1. The Way</h2>
              <p>The Way that can be experienced is not true;<br>
              The world that can be constructed is not true.<br>
              The Way manifests all that happens and may happen;<br>
              The world represents all that exists and may exist.</p>

              <p>To experience without intention is to sense the world;<br>
              To experience with intention is to anticipate the world.<br>
              These two experiences are indistinguishable;<br>
              Their construction differs but their effect is the same.</p>

              <p>Beyond the gate of experience flows the Way,<br>
              Which is ever greater and more subtle than the world.</p>
            </section><!-- #the-way -->

            <section id="abstraction" class="chapter">
              <h2>2. Abstraction</h2>
              <p>When beauty is abstracted<br>
              Then ugliness has been implied;<br>
              When good is abstracted<br>
              Then evil has been implied.</p>

              <p>So alive and dead are abstracted from nature,<br>
              Difficult and easy abstracted from progress,<br>
              Long and short abstracted from contrast,<br>
              High and low abstracted from depth,<br>
              Song and speech abstracted from melody,<br>
              After and before abstracted from sequence.</p>

              <p>The sage experiences without abstraction,<br>
              And accomplishes without action;<br>
              He accepts the ebb and flow of things,<br>
              Nurtures them, but does not own them,<br>
              And lives, but does not dwell.</p>
            </section><!-- / #abstraction -->

            <section id="without-action" class="chapter">
              <h2>3. Without Action</h2>
              <p>Not praising the worthy prevents contention,<br>
              Not esteeming the valuable prevents theft,<br>
              Not displaying the beautiful prevents desire.</p>

              <p>In this manner the sage governs people:<br>
              Emptying their minds,<br>
              Filling their bellies,<br>
              Weakening their ambitions,<br>
              And strengthening their bones.</p>

              <p>If people lack knowledge and desire<br>
              Then they can not act;<br>
              If no action is taken<br>
              Harmony remains.</p>
            </section><!-- / #without-action -->

            <section id="limitless" class="chapter">
              <h2>4. Limitless</h2>
              <p>The Way is a limitless vessel;<br>
              Used by the self, it is not filled by the world;<br>
              It cannot be cut, knotted, dimmed or stilled;<br>
              Its depths are hidden, ubiquitous and eternal;<br>
              I don't know where it comes from;<br>
              It comes before nature.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="nature" class="chapter">
              <h2>5. Nature</h2>
              <p>Nature is not kind;<br>
              It treats all things impartially.<br>
              The Sage is not kind,<br>
              And treats all people impartially.</p>

              <p>Nature is like a bellows,<br>
              Empty, yet never ceasing its supply.<br>
              The more it moves, the more it yields;<br>
              So the sage draws upon experience<br>
              And cannot be exhausted.</p>
              </section>

              <section id="experience" class="chapter">
              <h2>6. Experience</h2>
              <p>Experience is a riverbed, <br>
              Its source hidden, forever flowing:<br>
              Its entrance, the root of the world,<br>
              The Way moves within it:<br>
              Draw upon it; it will not run dry.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="complete" class="chapter">
              <h2>7. Complete</h2>
              <p>Nature is complete because it does not serve itself.</p>

              <p>The sage places himself after and finds himself before,<br>
              Ignores his desire and finds himself content.</p>

              <p>He is complete because he does not serve himself.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="water" class="chapter">
              <h2>8. Water</h2>
              <p>The best of man is like water,<br>
              Which benefits all things, and does not contend with them,<br>
              Which flows in places that others disdain,<br>
              Where it is in harmony with the Way.</p>

              <p>So the sage:<br>
              Lives within nature,<br>
              Thinks within the deep,<br>
              Gives within impartiality,<br>
              Speaks within trust,<br>
              Governs within order,<br>
              Crafts within ability,<br>
              Acts within opportunity.</p>

              <p>He does not contend, and none contend against him.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="retire" class="chapter">
              <h2>9. Retire</h2>

              <p>Fill a cup to its brim and it is easily spilled;<br>
              Temper a sword to its hardest and it is easily broken;<br>
              Amass the greatest treasure and it is easily stolen;<br>
              Claim credit and honour and you easily fall;<br>
              Retire once your purpose is achieved - this is natural.</p>

              <h2>10. Harmony</h2>
              <p>Embracing the Way, you become embraced;<br>
              Breathing gently, you become newborn;<br>
              Clearing your mind, you become clear;<br>
              Nurturing your children, you become impartial;<br>
              Opening your heart, you become accepted;<br>
              Accepting the world, you embrace the Way.</p>

              <p>Bearing and nurturing,<br>
              Creating but not owning,<br>
              Giving without demanding,<br>
              This is harmony.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="tools" class="chapter">
              <h2>11. Tools</h2>
              <p>Thirty spokes meet at a nave;<br>
              Because of the hole we may use the wheel.<br>
              Clay is moulded into a vessel;<br>
              Because of the hollow we may use the cup.<br>
              Walls are built around a hearth;<br>
              Because of the doors we may use the house.<br>
              Thus tools come from what exists,<br>
              But use from what does not.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="substance" class="chapter">

              <p>Too much colour blinds the eye,<br>
              Too much music deafens the ear,<br>
              Too much taste dulls the palate,<br>
              Too much play maddens the mind,<br>
              Too much desire tears the heart.</p>

              <p>In this manner the sage cares for people:<br>
              He provides for the belly, not for the senses;<br>
              He ignores abstraction and holds fast to substance.</p>

              The object of hope and fear is the self -<br>
              For, without self, to whom may fortune and disaster occur?</p>

              <h2>38. Ritual</h2>
              <p>Well established hierarchies are not easily uprooted;<br>
              Closely held beliefs are not easily released;<br>
              So ritual enthralls generation after generation.</p>

              <p>Harmony does not care for harmony, and so is naturally attained;<br>
              But ritual is intent upon harmony, and so can not attain it.</p>

              <p>Harmony neither acts nor reasons;<br>
              Love acts, but without reason;<br>
              Justice acts to serve reason;<br>
              But ritual acts to enforce reason.</p>

              <p>When the Way is lost, there remains harmony;<br>
              When harmony is lost, there remains love;<br>
              When love is lost, there remains justice;<br>
              But when justice is lost, there remains ritual.</p>

              <p>Ritual is the end of compassion and honesty,<br>
              The beginning of confusion;<br>
              Belief is a colourful hope or fear,<br>
              The beginning of folly.</p>

              <p>The sage goes by harmony, not by hope;<br>
              He dwells in the fruit, not the flower;<br>
              He accepts substance, and ignores abstraction.</p>

              All the mountains were firm,<br>
              All the riverbeds were full,<br>
              All of nature was fertile,<br>
              And all the rulers were supported.</p>

              <p>But, losing clarity, the sky tore;<br>
              Losing stability, the earth split;<br>
              Losing strength, the mountains sank;<br>
              Losing water, the riverbeds cracked;<br>
              Losing fertility, nature disappeared;<br>
              And losing support, the rulers fell.</p>

              <p>Rulers depend upon their subjects,<br>
              The noble depend upon the humble;<br>
              So rulers call themselves orphaned, hungry and alone,<br>

              <p>To govern men in accord with nature<br>
              It is best to be restrained;<br>
              Restraint makes agreement easy to attain,<br>

              With sufficient harmony no resistance will arise;<br>
              When no resistance arises, then you possess the heart of the nation,<br>

              But maintain your independence from them.</p>

              <h2>81. The Sage</h2>
              <p>Honest people use no rhetoric;<br>
              Rhetoric is not honesty.<br>
              Enlightened people are not cultured;<br>
              Culture is not enlightenment.<br>
              Content people are not rich;<br>
              Riches are not contentment.</p>

              <p>So the sage does not serve himself;<br>
              The more he does for others, the more he is satisfied;<br>
              The more he gives, the more he receives.<br>
              Nature flourishes at the expense of no one;<br>
              So the sage benefits all men and contends with none.</p>
